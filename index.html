<h1 id='fDbACAqz22Q'>Task 1: Generate your playlist</h1>

<p id='fDbACAjPiTw' class='line'>To get your feet wet,  we'll introduce you to a ton of music from a variety of genres that I personally think is great, but it's no secret that everybody's music tastes are different. As such, we'd be cheating you if we used one specific set curriculum for the whole course.</p>

<p id='fDbACA3CuTJ' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='fDbACAf9yDD' class='line'>While the main objective of this course is obviously to teach you a language through music, we also aim to give you the key to open up for yourself the door that leads into an incredible world of music (and other native media) in your target language that you probably never even imagined the extent of.</p>

<p id='fDbACARQxQi' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='fDbACARruNf' class='line'>You should not learn a language for the simple sake of learning the language in itself; In other words, learning a language is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Rather, you should learn a language <i>in order to</i> access the culture and everything it has to offer, which includes its people, its foods, its music, and last but not least, its entertainment productions.</p>

<p id='fDbACAEvW0U' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='fDbACA6MYj6' class='line'>That is the basis behind LangRey, and that is what we feel that the large majority of the world currently fails to understand.</p>

<p id='fDbACAurFDT' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='fDbACAO5agt' class='line'>Your first task is to use the LangRey master playlist to develop your own playlist of songs that you personally enjoy; after these short instructions, you'll find our suggestions for finding more awesome music that suits your tastes in your target language. These new songs will then be run through the LangRey analysis engine and gutted for their valuable tidbits.</p>

<h2 id='fDbACAqZkbx'><u>Instructions</u></h2>

<div data-section-style='6'><ul id='fDbACAok5A2'><li id='fDbACATzA1M' class='' value='1'><span id='fDbACATzA1M'>Download Spotify (you can download the free version - premium allows specific song selection and more song skipping, but for LangRey it isn’t necessary right now, because you can just put my playlist on shuffle)</span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACA7dY3v' class=''><span id='fDbACA7dY3v'>Follow me: michaelsking1993</span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACAcFVVJ' class=''><span id='fDbACAcFVVJ'>Open the “LangRey  Spanish” playlist (<b>Note: the playlist is still under construction. It currently consists of one huge glob of songs that have not been separated by genre; however, within the next few days, the playlist will be separated into one smaller introduction playlist, followed by a variety of playlists divided by genre).</b></span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACAYLPfM' class=''><span id='fDbACAYLPfM'>Create your own empty playlist; name it whatever you'd like.</span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACAQwYdA' class=''><span id='fDbACAQwYdA'>Listen through the songs, skipping ones you don’t like, and moving those you do like to your own playlist (on a computer, just drag and drop the song name over your playlist)</span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACAOkOhW' class='parent'><span id='fDbACAOkOhW'>When you get to the end of the LangRey playlist, share your new personal playlist with me, and then briefly play with the following two tools (or, at the very least, I recommend bookmarking them for potential future use)</span>

<br/></li><ul><li id='fDbACA6w8q7' class=''><span id='fDbACA6w8q7'><a href="http://noosayoghurt-spotify.com">noosayoghurt-spotify.com</a> - Find two songs that you really enjoyed from the LangRey playlist(s), put in the name of their artists, and the website will generate for you a Spotify playlist of 20 songs, based on those artists.</span>

<br/></li><li id='fDbACAzgCte' class=''><span id='fDbACAzgCte'> <a href="http://musicroamer.com/">http://musicroamer.com/</a> - Find any one artist that you really liked from the playlist, input the artist, and it will create a great visual map that shows 6 artists similar to the inputted artist, along with a sampling of their music. You can then click on one of <i>those</i> new artists to see even <b>more </b>artists that are similar to that new artist. A really great tool.<control data-remapped="true" id="fDbACACVJYM"><a href="https://quip.com/8CznAzIrdQDX">“Question(s) of the day”</a></control></span>

<br/></li></ul></ul></div><p id='fDbACAN1vNW' class='line'>Now you can move on to your next task, which is to <a href="https://quip.com/8CznAzIrdQDX">read about and respond to your first “Question(s) of the day”</a> (contained in the “Writing” folder)</p>
